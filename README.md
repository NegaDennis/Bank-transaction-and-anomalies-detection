# Bank-transaction-and-anomalies-detection


It's a work in progress!!! The codes and analysis file are done. Can be accessed directly from 'codes' folder in this repo. Will continue to populate the missing parts of this README next.

## Data understanding


The dataset is a direct copy of the Bank Transaction Dataset for Fraud Detection from Kaggle. The dataset was last updated on 04/11/2024.


This dataset provides a detailed look into transactional behavior and financial activity patterns, ideal for exploring fraud detection and anomaly identification. It contains 2,512 samples of transaction data, covering various transaction attributes, customer demographics, and usage patterns. Each entry offers comprehensive insights into transaction behavior, enabling analysis for financial security and fraud detection applications.

The dataset was synthesized based on realistic bank transaction patterns from publicly available sources, including research studies, industry reports, fraud detection surveys and other relevant studies.


The dataset is made up of individual transactions made from 2023-01-03 to 2024-01-02,

## Motivation

This is a practice of EDA and machine learning application on banking data.

At the end of the project, the goals include:
1. Performed well-coded EDA with valueable insights.
2. Developed a clustering model that properly segment transactions and accounts.
3. Codes are well-documented and pythonic.
